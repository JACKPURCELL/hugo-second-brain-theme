I found that at the level of local data legislation, it is all related to the local economic and political and cultural climate. Because Shanghai is the economic center, and I have lived in Shanghai for 4 years, I know that Shanghai is a city that cares about fairness and efficiency, so its data legislation is as detailed as possible and easy to carry out. For example, it first encourages to establish chief data officer system, defines the nature of personal and organizational data, specifies the content of data collection and processing, as well as provides for a notification and consent system for processors. Shanghai is also the first to provide individuals with the right to Correct and delete personal data. 

Beijing, the political center of the city, has relatively vague and elusive provisions. 

Guangzhou, because the city's manufacturing industry is more developed, can see that its data legislation tries to include various industries, and it is difficult to be specific if you want to be all-encompassing.
